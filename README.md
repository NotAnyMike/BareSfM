# Bare Struncture from Motion model

This is an implementation using pytorch of the basic approach of Structure from Motion models (or Self-supervised monocular depth estimation) models as explained [here (Unsupervised depth estimation)](https://notanymike.github.io/Unsupervised-depth-estimation/)

##Â Tests

Run `py.test -v test/tests.py`
